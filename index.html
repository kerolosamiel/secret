        <p>
          This is our first Valentine‚Äôs Day, my love. I really wished to be with
          you today. I want you to be sure that you are the most important
          person in my life from day one, ya Falfola, and I can‚Äôt live without
          you. On this day, I just want to tell you that I love you so much. You
          are my dream, and I will keep fighting to reach it. I hope that next
          year, we‚Äôll be together on this day and make it exactly as we wish.
        </p>
        <p>You are my best moment.‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
